SHORT DESCRIPTION
	Provides intelligent autocomplete, inline suggestions, and custom autofill for PowerShell.

LONG DESCRIPTION
	PowerShellAutocomplete is a productivity module that enhances your PowerShell experience with:
	- Inline suggestions as you type, powered by built-in, learned, and custom completions.
	- Tab completion for commands and arguments.
	- Command history learning: frequently used arguments are suggested.
	- User-defined custom autofill statements, which can be managed and suggested alongside built-in completions.
	- Tab navigation between suggestion types (built-in/learned and custom) using keyboard shortcuts.

	Features:
	* Inline suggestions appear in light gray (built-in/learned) or yellow (custom) as you type.
	* Accept suggestions with the Right Arrow key.
	* Switch between suggestion tabs (built-in/learned vs. custom) using Ctrl+RightArrow and Ctrl+LeftArrow.
	* Add your own custom suggestions with Add-CustomSuggestion.
	* Suggestions are context-aware and learn from your command history.

	Custom suggestions are stored in a JSON file and persist across sessions.
